# Secure Boot

## Overview

This readme file outlines the implementation of a secure boot process using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to enhance the security of the system. The secure boot process ensures that only trusted and authenticated firmware or applications are allowed to execute during the boot sequence.

## Key Components

### 1. Key Generation and Storage

- The HSM is responsible for generating cryptographic keys, including a root key, which serves as a foundation for secure boot operations.

### 2. Root of Trust Establishment

- The HSM is considered part of the Root of Trust (RoT), providing a secure environment for key management and cryptographic operations.

### 3. Bootloader Initialization

- The secure boot process starts with the initialization of the bootloader, the initial stage responsible for initiating the boot sequence.

### 4. Verification of Bootloader Signature

- The bootloader contains a digital signature, signed with a private key stored in the HSM. The signature is verified during boot, ensuring the authenticity of the bootloader.

### 5. Chain of Trust

- The bootloader verifies the next stage in the boot process, creating a chain of trust where each stage verifies the integrity of the next.

### 6. Verification of Application Signature

- The bootloader verifies the digital signature of the application or firmware image using the public key stored in the HSM.

### 7. Hash Verification

- Alongside signature verification, the bootloader calculates a hash of the application image and compares it against a precomputed hash stored in the HSM.

### 8. Policy Enforcement

- The secure boot process enforces policies, including requirements for signed code, specific hash values, or other criteria set by the system administrator or device manufacturer.

### 9. Hardware-Based Checks

- The HSM may perform additional hardware-based checks, such as measuring the firmware or application code, to create a unique fingerprint.

### 10. Boot Decision

- If all verification steps are successful, the boot process continues, and the application is allowed to run. If any verification fails, the boot process is halted, preventing the execution of untrusted or compromised code.

## Implementation Details

- The implementation details of the secure boot process using the HSM are specific to the system architecture and the HSM model. Always refer to the documentation provided by the HSM manufacturer for accurate and detailed implementation instructions.

## Security Considerations

- Secure booting enhances the overall security posture of the system by preventing unauthorized or compromised firmware from executing during the boot process.
