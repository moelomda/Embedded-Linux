# Secure Flashing Process for Embedded Systems

The secure flashing process ensures the integrity, authenticity, and security of software updates (flashing) for embedded systems

## Overview

The process involves a series of steps to guarantee the authenticity and integrity of the firmware update:

1. **Key Generation and Digital Signatures:**
   - Private and public keys (SK, PK) are generated for digital signatures, providing integrity and authenticity.
  
2. **Hashing and Signature Generation:**
   - The program code (x) undergoes hashing (SHA) to produce a fixed-length value (y). A digital signature is generated by signing the hashed value (y) with the private key (SK).

3. **Certificates:**
   - Public keys are embedded in each embedded system, and firmware programs are signed using corresponding private keys. Certificates include the public key signed by the OEM's private key, providing authentication.

4. **Verification of Certificates and Signatures:**
   - Certificates are downloaded and verified using the OEM's root public key (PK). The flash program is then downloaded and verified using the public key (PKA) from the certificate.
   **note that**
   the OEM refers to the original equipment manufacturer, which is typically the manufacturer of the vehicle or the embedded system. The OEM is responsible for producing the original hardware, including Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in vehicles.
5. **Secure Software Flashing:**
   - The software flashing process involves multiple steps:
     - Software development completion.
     - Signing by a trust center using its private key.
     - Storage in a database.
     - During flashing, verification using the public key in the embedded system.

6. **Challenge-Response Identification:**
   - A challenge-response mechanism is implemented to protect the public key in the embedded system. An external party runs a challenge-response scheme to prove knowledge of the secret key before adjusting parameters.
   **note that**
   Challenge-Response Identification is a security mechanism used to authenticate and verify the identity of a party (such as an external device or user) by exchanging a challenge and its corresponding response. This method ensures that the responding party possesses the necessary secret or cryptographic key without revealing that key during the process. Here's a breakdown of the Challenge-Response Identification process:
   
7. **Flash Program File Processing:**
   - The flash program file is divided into blocks, optionally encrypted, and pre-signed. The flashing process involves:
     - Authentication of the bootloader by the external device.
     - Verification of certificates by the bootloader.
     - Block-by-block transfer, decryption, and storage by the bootloader.
     - Incremental hashing of each block.
     - Finalization of hash computation and digital signature verification.
     - Acceptance and activation of the downloaded file if signature verification is successful.

8. **Safety Measures:**
   - If signature verification fails, a safety procedure is activated, and the bootloader awaits the download of a proper flash file. This ensures that only legitimate and unaltered software is accepted by the embedded system.

## Conclusion

The described secure flashing process incorporates digital signatures, certificates, and cryptographic mechanisms to guarantee the authenticity, integrity, and security of the firmware update process for embedded systems like ECUs in vehicles.
