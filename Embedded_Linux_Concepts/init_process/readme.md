### What is the init process?

- **The First Process:** `init` has the special process ID (PID) of 1. It's the very first process started by the kernel during the boot process and runs continuously until the system is shut down.
  
- **Parent of All:** `init` serves as the root or ancestor of all other processes in the system. It directly or indirectly creates every process that subsequently runs.

- **System Initialization:** The core responsibility of `init` is to perform various system initialization tasks, bringing a fully functioning user environment up and running.

### Key Tasks of `init`

Traditionally, `init` would handle things like:

- **Reading Configuration Files:** Typically from `/etc/inittab`. Here, configurations dictate what tasks to execute, and based on runlevels.

- **Mounting Filesystems:** Making sure root and other crucial file systems are available for use.

- **Starting Essential Services:** Launching daemons like the login manager (getty processes), system loggers, networking services, and more.

- **Runlevel Management:** Moving the system through different operation states (e.g., single-user mode, multi-user mode, graphical mode).

- **Orphaned Process Management:** Reaping orphan processes (those whose parents have terminated) to prevent them from becoming zombie processes.

### Evolution of `init`

- **Traditional SysVinit:** Early Linux distributions used an init based on the System V init (SysVinit) system. This used runlevels and read instructions from the `/etc/inittab` file.

- **Modern systemd:** Many modern Linux distributions have replaced SysVinit with systemd. This brings new concepts like targets, unit files, and a focus on dependency management for managing services.

  ###  BusyBox init

  - **Small Footprint:** In embedded devices, storage space is typically limited. BusyBox init significantly diminishes the space occupied by the init process compared to comprehensive init systems such as systemd.

  - **Simplification:** Traditional init systems or systemd entail numerous components and intricate configurations. BusyBox init adopts a streamlined approach, often depending on a straightforward `/etc/inittab` file.

  - **Customization:** Similar to other BusyBox components, init offers high configurability. This is crucial for devices with restricted resources and distinct software and hardware requirements.

  ### How BusyBox init Works

  - **Kernel Launches:** Just like standard processes, the Linux kernel initiates BusyBox's init as process ID (PID) 1.

  - **Reading /etc/inittab:** Fundamentally, BusyBox init interprets directives from the `/etc/inittab` file. This file comprises entries dictating commands to execute under various circumstances.

  #### Entry Types in /etc/inittab:

  - **sysinit:** Commands executed once at the outset of the boot process.

  - **respawn:** Commands for processes meant to persistently run (if they terminate unexpectedly, init restarts them). Often utilized for login getty processes.

  - **askfirst:** Similar to respawn, but init prompts before restarting a process.

  - **wait:** Commands executed once, where init subsequently awaits their completion.

  - **once:** Commands executed once as the system boots.

  - **ctrlaltdel:** Actions triggered by Ctrl+Alt+Delete input.

  - **shutdown:** Actions performed upon system shutdown.

  #### Example /etc/inittab entry:

  ```plaintext
  ::sysinit:/bin/mount -a   # Mount all filesystems 
  ::respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 115200 vt100 # Launch a login prompt on
