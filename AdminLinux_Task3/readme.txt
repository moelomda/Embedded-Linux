When the script opens another terminal
The new terminal is independent of the terminal from which the script was executed. 
It operates in its own process and does not rely on the original terminal for its functioning.
The new terminal starts with its own environment, shell, and working directory.
 It is not directly affected by the state of the original terminal.
Depending on how the script is run, the user may see some output related to the terminal launching process.
 This output might include information about the terminal emulator or any error messages.
